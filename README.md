# Movie Gallery Project

## Project Overview

This project is a gallery of movies, TV series, and games sourced from the IMDB database. It utilizes a mock API with a subset of real data from IMDB.

## Features

- **Main Screen**: Users can view cards displaying movies, TV series, and games.
- **View Switching**: Users can toggle between list view and gallery view.
- **Editable Titles**: Clicking on a movie's title allows the user to edit it. However, a message will always pop up indicating that the save operation failed (since updating the real IMDB database is not possible).
- **Filtering**: Users can filter results by type (movie, TV series) and by free text.
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on a movie's poster navigates the user to a detailed page displaying additional information about the movie.

## Technologies Used

- **React (TypeScript)**: The entire project is written in React using TypeScript.
- **Bootstrap**: Styling and design are done using Bootstrap.

## How to Use

1. **Viewing Cards**: On the main screen, you can view all available cards for movies, TV series, and games.
2. **Switching Views**: Use the toggle to switch between list view and gallery view.
3. **Editing Titles**: Click on a movie's title to edit it. Note that any attempt to save will fail, as indicated by a pop-up message.
4. **Filtering**: Use the filter options to narrow down results by type or search by free text.
5. **Detailed Information**: Click on the movie's poster to be redirected to the movie's detailed page.
